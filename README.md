# PawKit

PawKit is a mninimal game engine toolkit, written in Rust, with support for C / C++.

In the future PawKit will support C#, Godot, Lua, and Javascript.

Most of the features are extremely opinionated, as it's being used for Pawprint (our game engine)

## Why a monorepo?

A monorepo helps me organize better, and keep everything working with the latest versions of each other.
